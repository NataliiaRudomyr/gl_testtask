Hello!
First of all, I need to say , that I used jsonplaceholder API instead of swapi Api because it didn`t work
So, you need to clone my project from repository, go to the terminal and set all dependencies (npm i/yarn add) and the start the project (npm start/yart start).
First page is home page with greetings, and second page is table with data which I get from API, for fetch I used axios library.
